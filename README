# Product and Order Management Application

This project is a web application for managing products and orders. It was developed as part of a technical test.

## 1. Problem Description

The goal of the technical test was to develop a web application that allows users to:

- View a list of available products with their name, price, and stock.
- Select products and add them to an order list.
- Calculate the total amount for the order list.
- Generate an order with the selected products.
- View a history of orders.

## 2. Approach and Strategy

- **Technology Stack:** The application was developed using Spring Boot with Thymeleaf for the presentation layer and JavaScript for user interaction.
- **Data Model:** A data model with two entities was implemented: `Product` and `Order`.
- **Application Logic:** Controllers and services were implemented to handle the application logic, including adding products to the order list, calculating the total, and generating orders.
- **User Interface:** JavaScript was used to handle user interactions such as selecting products, updating the total amount, and generating orders.

## 3. Implementation

- **Data Model:** The `Product` and `Order` entities were defined with the necessary attributes.
- **Presentation Layer:** HTML views were created using Thymeleaf to display the list of products, the order list, and the order history.
- **Application Logic:** Controllers and services were implemented to handle the core logic of the application.
- **User Interaction:** JavaScript was used to manage user interactions like selecting products, calculating the total, and generating orders.

## 4. Results

A functional web application was developed that meets the requirements of the technical test. The application allows users to efficiently manage products and orders.

## 5. Reflection

During the development of this application, I gained experience using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and JavaScript to build web applications. I faced challenges in formatting prices in the user interface, which required research and the application of string manipulation techniques.

## 6. Future Improvements

- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling by using custom exceptions and providing more informative error messages.
- **Testing:** Expand test coverage with more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
